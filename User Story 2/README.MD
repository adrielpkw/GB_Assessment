# User Story 2: Sortable Data Grid

### Brief Project Description

This project is a single web page that displays a sortable data grid of currency and amount records.  
It is built using only vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, in accordance with the project requirements. 

The key features are:
* A data grid with "Currency" and "Amount" columns.
* The ability to sort each column in both ascending and descending order.
* A custom parsing logic in JavaScript to handle and correctly sort amounts that are formatted differently depending on locality (e.g., using both `.` and `,` as decimal or thousands separators).
* Currency is sorted alphabetically ('string'), while Amount is sorted numerically ('number').

### How to Run

Simply open the `User Story 2/index.html` file in any modern web browser. No server or build process is required.
